    <h1>How to change Windows version to anything you want | winaviation2</h1>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="content">
<p>Note: The current Windows you're using won't change even you change the Windows version. This means changing the Windows version doesn't affect the OS.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The software that is required:</p>
    <br>
    <li>Resource Hacker</li>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>How to change the Windows version.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The result will shown in msinfo32 or winver.</p>
    <br>
    <li>First, we will open Resource Hacker, a 3rd-party software.</li>
    <li>Click the open icon and navigate to C:\Windows\Branding\Basebrd\en-US\basebrd.dll.mui. Open that file.</li>
    <li>Expand "String Table" and find the resource that contains the name of your current Windows version, for me, is Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC.</li> <!-- LTSC sucks gotcha gtg back --->
    <li>Now you can change the Windows version simply by just edit the the text.</li>
    <li>Save the file with the name "basebrd.dll.mui" (overwrites the old file) after you finished changing.</li>
    <br>
    <p>Now when you open msinfo32 or winver, it will display your custom Windows version.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Changing winver Windows logo</h2>
    <br>
    <li>First, use any image editor and create your own custom logo (remember to save as .bmp and the image resolution needs to be 458 x 72)</li>
    <li>Open Resource Hacker again. This time we will open C:\Windows\Branding\Basebrd\basebrd.dll</li>
    <li>Select "Bitmap" and right click it, then click "Replace Bitmap".</li>
    <li>Open the image that you created for the custom logo.</li>
    <li>Now you will click "Replace".</li>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, you're done!</p>
<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Changing the build version</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Yes, you can change the build version to anything you wanted, like changing from 19044 to Windows Balls Edition.</p>
<br>
    <p>Coming soon... Nah I don't think is coming soon, cuz I guess thats not possible...</p>
<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Changing msconfig OS name</h2>
    <br>
    <p>When you open msconfig, you will see your default OS name, yes there is a way to change it. Normally you don't see any such options to rename, you must use cmd.exe</p>
    <br>
    <p>Tutorial!</p>
    <br>
    <li>Open cmd.exe</li>
    <li>Enter this command: bcdedit /set {current} description "x"</li>
    <br>
    <p>Replace x with the name of your custom Windows version. After that you are done!</p>
