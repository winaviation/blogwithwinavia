    <ul>
      <li>Windows is the most used operating system in the world and was easy to use for everyone except babies.</li>
      <br>
      <li>When you install a Windows 10 Insider Build and you got BSOD, the background color is green instead of blue like regular verisons. So, it's GSOD now, not BSOD lol</li>
      <br>
      <li>Windows 11 backgrounds are now all black and not a single blue. Except that QR code in the B(lack)SOD.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The fact that you can <b>change the version</b> of Windows in the Registry settings, like you change the value from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 69420 Pro Max. Though you also need to change the dll and mui file so it looks real.</li>

      <br>
      <li>The first version, Windows 1.0, came out in 1983 and was less than 1MB in size! It ran on a measly 256KB of RAM.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Windows wasn't originally an idea by Microsoft, but rather a licensed concept from Apple's Macintosh System Software. What?? For the first time I read this I was surprised by this...</li>
      <br>
      <li>Windows 95 was a monumental release, credited with making computers more user-friendly and popularizing the "Start" button and taskbar.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Windows 98 was the last Windows OS based on MS-DOS, marking a significant shift towards the more stable and modern NT architecture.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Windows is the dominant desktop operating system globally, with over 90% market share. That's more than the entire population of North and South America combined!</li>
      <br>
      <li>There are about 1.36 billion active Windows users, which is roughly the number of people who speak English as a first language.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Windows has supported various platforms throughout its history, including ARM, ARM-64, x86-64, and IA-32, making it incredibly versatile.</li>
      <br>
      <p>Other fun facts:</p>
      <br>
      <li>The iconic "Recycle Bin" was originally called "Trash Can", but the name was changed due to concerns about offending international users.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The Windows XP startup sound is actually a modified version of a Yamaha sound card jingle.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The blue screen of death (BSOD) has its own error codes, some with humorous names like "DRIVER_WEAPONS_QUIETLY_RETURNED" and "PNP_DETECTED_STALE_DEVICE_INSTANCE". Bro what, I don't think this is real because Google's Bard gave me this info ðŸ’€</li>
